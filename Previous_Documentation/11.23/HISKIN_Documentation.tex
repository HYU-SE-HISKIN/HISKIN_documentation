\begin{abstract}

Nowadays, with the increasing importance of skincare, a growing number of busy modern people are trying skincare at home by purchasing beauty devices instead of going to a dermatologist. For these customers, companies such as LG and FOREO are providing beauty devices and applications that can be linked to them. However, managing at home with a beauty device has several weaknesses in place of dermatology. First, there is a lack of communication. Many companies are trying to provide communication such as management methods, but it is still not enough to replace dermatology. The second is that it ends with care. Skin care requires care tailored to one's own skin type even after care, but there is a lack of action. To develop an application that can compensate for these weaknesses, our team is trying to develop a user-friendly application called HI-SKIN that can work with beauty devices for those who have difficulty taking care of their skin. It is managed by a beauty device registered by a user, and at the same time, it enables communication with users by using AI voice recognition technology. It provides communication functions on various topics such as skin care tips, daily conversations, and management methods according to the user's mood in addition to the existing function of providing guidance on how to use devices. Through these functions, we expect users can enjoy the same service as meeting a doctor in person. And also, through additional challenges program, users can take care of their skin not only at the moment they use the device, but also after care or normally. Depending on the user's skin type, the challenge provides a user-friendly skin care function while allowing the user to perform missions such as moisture soothing pack and drinking more than 1L of water per day. In these days, when the desire to be beautiful continues to increase, concerns about good skin are inevitably growing, and our application HI-SKIN will be a good solution in this situation. \cite{zhang2020impact}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation} 
According to a survey conducted by market research firm Embrain Trend Monitor in 2022, significant changes in awareness about skincare have been observed. The survey targeted 1,000 adults aged 19 to 59 and examined their perceptions related to skincare. The results showed a decrease in satisfaction with their skin condition from 41.4\% in 2019 to 37.8\%. Furthermore, 64.2\% of respondents reported increased concerns about their skin. This data suggests that many people have become less satisfied with their skin condition recently, leading them to desire healthier and more vibrant skin.
\\Several factors contribute to this shift in perception. Firstly, in today's era of social media, platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook provide easy access to information about skincare and beauty. Influencers and beauty experts share product reviews, skincare tips, and personal experiences, inspiring users to take a greater interest in skincare and develop their skincare routines.
\\Secondly, there is a rising interest in health and well-being. Healthy skin is perceived as a crucial indicator of overall health and well-being, prompting many individuals to pursue better health through skincare. Skincare is not only seen as a means to enhance one's appearance but also as a way to improve skin health.
\\As a result of these trends, interest in skincare and beauty devices has been on the rise. According to Embrain Trend Monitor's survey, there is a growing interest in home beauty and skincare. 81.2\% of women perceive skincare devices as popular, and products like those from LG Pra.L and Medique have been predicted to become more prevalent. These devices are considered cost-effective alternatives that allow for convenient skincare at home compared to visiting dermatologists.
\begin{figure} [h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{fig/PraL1.jpg}
    \caption{LG Pra.L Care}
\end{figure}
\\However, this increased interest and device usage come with some skepticism and concerns. Users have doubts about the safety and effectiveness of skincare devices, and there are worries about the potential side effects of performing skincare independently. In fact, a significant percentage of consumers have experienced side effects when using home beauty devices. According to a 2019 survey by the Consumer Education Center, 10\% of users reported experiencing side effects. This is often due to a lack of information about potential side effects associated with these devices, highlighting a communication gap between users and skincare devices that differs from traditional dermatology practices.
\\In conclusion, the changing perceptions of skincare and home beauty are the result of various interacting factors, leading to emerging market trends and consumer demands related to skincare devices. Therefore, we have decided to create a more comfortable, safe, and user-friendly app to accompany skincare devices to address these evolving consumer needs. \cite{kim2022skincare}


\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item [1] Many people are currently experiencing significant difficulties and discomfort while using skincare beauty devices. The reason for this is that skincare beauty devices often fail to provide users with sufficient information about the potential risks and side effects, unlike procedures conducted by professional skincare experts or dermatologists.\\ \cite{Song2022beautydevice}
\item [2] Consumers often struggle to establish consistent skincare routines even when using skincare beauty devices. This is primarily because these devices typically provide instructions and information specific to the device itself, often lacking personalized advice based on individual users' skin conditions and needs.\\
\item [3] Consumers consider homecare devices as alternatives to dermatological services, seeking a similar experience even if not entirely equivalent. However, currently available skincare beauty devices often fall short in providing users with comprehensive information compared to dermatologists, making users perceive them as somewhat "clinical." Furthermore, when receiving skincare services at a dermatologist's office, the interaction with the dermatologist adds an element of "fun" or engagement to the experience, which is lacking when using skincare beauty devices. Consequently, many consumers desire to acquire enjoyable or informative aspects akin to visiting a dermatologist while using skincare beauty devices.
\end{itemize}

  \item[b.]Tools and Language

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1.]Java
        \item[]Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and other researchers. It is one of the most commonly used languages in the web application field and is also widely used in software development for mobile devices including Android. Millions of Java applications are in use today as a result of their popularity among developers for over 20 years. It's a fast, secure and reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies. In addition, it is a very suitable language for game development, database processing, big data, and distributed processing. Our team will develop an application, so we will build a backend server using Java.\\

        \item[2.]Spring Boot 
        \item[]The Java Spring Framework is a popular enterprise-class open-source framework for creating production-class standalone applications running on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java Spring Boot is a tool that helps you develop web applications and microservices faster and more easily using the Spring Framework through three core functions. Automatic configuration, a self-righteous approach to configuration, and the ability to create standalone applications. These features work together to provide tools to help you set up Spring-based applications with minimal configuration and settings. Because of these advantages, our team decided to use the Spring Boot framework to build backend servers in this project.\\ \\

        \item[3.]Hibernate \cite{fisher2010spring}
        \item[]Hibernate is an ORM framework intended to translate between relational databases and the realm of object-oriented development. Hibernate provides a querying interface, using Hibernate Query Language (HQL) or the Hibernate Criteria API. Using hibernate increases productivity because queries can be performed only by method calls without using SQL directly, and it is also excellent in terms of maintenance because it performs the parameters, results, etc. of the DAO related to the table when the table column is changed.Together, Spring and Hibernate are a dynamic duo, capable of simplifying dependency collaboration, reducing coupling, and providing abstractions over persistence operations. Since our team decided to use spring boot for the backend server, we decided to use hibernate, which is well matched with spring boot, to build the database.\\

        \item[4.]Jupyter Notebook \cite{jupyterNotebook}
        \item[]Jupyter Notebook is the most widely-used system for interactive literate programming. It was designed to make data analysis easier to document, share, and reproduce. Jupyter originated from IPython and, in addition to Python, it supports a variety of programming languages, such as Julia, R, JavaScript, and C.

        \item[]TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Its computational model is based on dataflow graphs with mutable state. Graph nodes may be mapped to different machines in a cluster, and within each machine to CPUs, GPUs, and other devices. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, but it particularly targets training and inference with deep neural networks. It serves as a platform for research and for deploying machine learning systems across many areas. \\

        \item[7.]PyTorch
        \item[]PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. Our goal with PyTorch is to build a flexible framework to express deep learning algorithms. \\

        \item[8.]Docker
        \item[]Docker was designed in order to simplify the creation, deployment and execution of applications using containers. Containerization allows the user to run applications in a virtual environment by packaging all necessary elements such as files, libraries and other essential components together. Furthermore, containers play a vital role in DevOps processes as an integral part of automated software builds or as part of continuous deployment. \\

        \item[9.]Git \cite{velog-git}
        \item[]Git serves as an effective tool for managing versions, facilitating the seamless integration of changes and updates. However, prior to delving into Git, it's important to grasp the concept of a 'version control system.' Essentially, a version control system captures and monitors modifications made to a file, enabling easy retrieval of any previous iteration when needed. While working on a document, multiple revisions take place, progressing from the initial draft to the ultimate version. Often, files are renamed as 'final,' 'final copy,' 'finalized,' and so on, leading to the replacement of previous versions. This practice can complicate the process of reverting to a specific point in time to understand the alterations made. However, a version control system resolves this challenge. It enables the management of numerous iterations of the same data, facilitating the tracking of changes over time and attributing them to specific contributors. This simplifies the process of reverting to previous or original versions and promptly identifying the responsible individuals for any issues that may arise.\\

        \item[10.]JavaScript \cite{jensen2009type}
        \item[]JavaScript is the main scripting language for Web browsers, and it is essential to modern Web applications. We present a static program analysis infrastructure that can infer detailed information for JavaScript programs using abstract interpretation. The analysis is designed to support the full language as defined in the ECMAScript standard, including its peculiar object model and all built-in functions. The analysis results can be used to detect common programming errors – or rather, prove their absence, and for producing type information for program comprehension.\\

        \item[11.]React Native \cite{waren2016cross}
        \item[]React Native is an open source JavaScript framework for building mobile applications for both iOS and Android devices. It was open-sourced on March 2015 by Facebook, and it's based on the React framework published a few years earlier. \\
        
        \item[12.]Python
        \item[]Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike. It supports multiple programming paradigms and offers a vast array of libraries and frameworks, enabling developers to create diverse applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing. Its clear and concise syntax promotes easy comprehension, fostering rapid development and fostering a robust community that contributes to its continuous evolution and widespread adoption.\\

        \item[13.]Bert \cite{affi2021blc}
        \item[]The full name of BERT is Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, which is a language model representation based on self-attention blocks. The main innovation of the model is the pre-training method, which is trained with Masked LM and next sentence prediction to capture the word and sentence level representation respectively. BERT is pre-trained in different language model tasks using existing unmarked corpora. The pre-trained deep bidirectional model with one output layer can reach state-of-the-art performance in many tasks such as question answering and multi-genre natural language inference. The idea is to have a common architecture that fits many tasks and a pre-trained model that reduces the need for labeled data. for a given token, its vector representation is built by summing the corresponding, word, sub-word and position embeddings. These combinations of preprocessing steps make BERT so versatile. \\

        \item[14.]ELMo \cite{devlin2018bert}
        \item[]ELMo is a deep contextualized word representation that models both complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics) and how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (in order to model polysemy). ELMO extends a standard word embedding model with features produced bidirectionally with character convolutions. The writers in [16] showed that different layers in this deep recurrent model learn different aspects of a given token. Each token converts to a relevant representation using character embeddings. This character embedding representation is then run through a convolutional layer, followed by a max-pool layer. Finally, this representation is passed through a 2-layer highway network [30] before being provided as the input to the LSTM layer. These transformations to the input token allow the model to pick up on character-level features which are helpful for morphologically rich languages such that word-level embeddings could miss and deal with the OOV problem for various NLP tasks. By adding ELMO word embeddings to our model, the model will be able to infer representations for previously unseen words and obtain syntactic information at the morpheme level. \\

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{fig/overall architecture.png}
    \label{fig:Application Framwork}
    \caption{Application Framwork} 
    \end{figure} \\ 
\indent The first module that makes up the application is the frontend. Our team proceeded with development using React Native and expo. Users can perform skin type tests through the application and receive cosmetic recommendations. You can check the community page where application users can share their own beauty tips, and on the skincare challenge screen, you can check your own challenge score and a graph that analyzes your skin challenge for three months and six months.\\

The second module that makes up the application is the backend. A spring boot was used to build an application server, and hibernate was used as a database linked to it. The backend serves to perform the tasks requested by the user. Our application performs the functions of signing up and logging in, calculating skin type test results, recommending cosmetics, and calculating challenge scores. A user table, a skin type table, a challenge score table, and a challenge response table exist in the database. When the information is received from the user, the server stores the information in the database.\\

Another structure of our service is the Nugu speaker. When users take care of their skin using an LG Pra.L device, they can talk to Nugu speakers. The Nugu speaker was developed using the Nugu playbuilder provided by SKT, the AI backend linked to Nugu used Google Cloud Platform, and the language used node.js. There are a total of three intents in the conversation: solving skin problems, recommending cosmetics, and daily conversations. When the user talks to the speaker, it analyzes which of the three intentions are and responds to the user by outputting the data value received from the backend from the speaker among the various actions accordingly.

    \item[2.]Functionality: React Native facilitates communication between users and various components, as well as the backend, through the app's UI/UX. The frontend is developed using React, while the backend handles functionalities such as login, sign-up, skin type testing (with options for selecting skin types), skin type results, and challenges (with scores for each category). Throughout this process, the server connects this data with user information and stores it in the database.

\item[4.] Class Components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\bullet$] App: During the app loading process, all fonts are loaded from assets/fonts. Once this operation is complete, the components necessary to represent the app are rendered on the screen.
    \item[$\bullet$] Components: One of the features of React Native is the ability to create components and import them into screens. Building components for frequently used elements such as buttons and images, or for consistently structured components within the app like CommunityBox and ImageLinker, significantly simplifies the development process.
    \item[$\bullet$] User:  Using `useContext`, we can check whether the user has logged in or signed up, confirming whether the username and password information has been sent to the backend. If the information has been successfully transmitted, we can then immediately navigate from the AuthStack to the MainStack.
    \item[$\bullet$] AuthStack: Within the stack, there are Welcome, Login, and Signup screens.
    \item[$\bullet$] MainStack: Within the stack, there are MainTab as well as DeviceRegistration, Care, Challenge, SkinTypeTest, SkinTypeResult, Cosmetics, and SkinReport screens.
    \item[$\bullet$] MainTab: Within the stack, there are Home, Challenge, Care, Community, and Info screens.
    \item[$\bullet$] Welcome: It delivers the overall description of the HI-SKIN application in card format. Users can refer to the design, function, and structure of the application as they turn over these cards.
    \item[$\bullet$] Login: Users can input their ID and password. When they enter the data, the moment they press the 'Log In' button, the values are sent to the backend. If the backend database contains the information, the login is successful, and the user is directed to the home screen. If the user information is not found, they can navigate to the sign-up screen by clicking on the 'Sign Up' text at the bottom.
    \item[$\bullet$] Signup: Users can enter their name, gender, nickname, ID, and password. If they press the 'Sign Up' button, the data is sent to the backend and stored in the database. If there are no issues in this process, the user is immediately directed to the home screen with a successful sign-up message. The user can then log in using this ID and password. By clicking on the login text at the bottom of the sign-up page, they can return to the login screen.
    \item[$\bullet$] Home: After a successful login, the user is greeted with the main screen containing an overview of the app's functionalities. Various buttons provide access to device registration, skin type analysis, challenges, and cosmetic recommendations. At the bottom, users can also view community posts. If no devices are registered, users can press the "Device Registration" button to register a device. After registration, the device's appearance is displayed below the app logo. Clicking on the device picture allows users to navigate to the care screen. By clicking on the "Skin Type Test" button, users are directed to the skin type testing page. The "Challenge" button leads to the challenge screen. Clicking on the text "Cosmetic Recommendations" or cosmetic images takes users to the cosmetic recommendations page.
    \item[$\bullet$] DeviceRegistration: After the loading page, a message appears saying "The device has been registered," accompanied by an image of the registered device on the screen.
    \item[$\bullet$] Care: At the top, users can view a history of the devices they have used. Below that, a list of registered devices is displayed. Selecting a device reveals the care routine for that device, and clicking on the routine allows users to initiate the care process. The central image's animation changes according to the selected care routine, aligning with the chosen care.
    \item[$\bullet$] SkinTypeTest: The app displays 8 questions and 4 answer choices from `utils/skinTypeQuestions.js` on the screen. Upon selecting an answer choice, the choice turns red, and clicking the 'Next' button transitions to the next question. On the final 8th question, clicking the 'Complete' button sends the selected choices to the backend. The app then receives the examination results from the backend, and these results are passed to the `SkinTypeResult` screen, which is navigated to upon clicking 'Complete.'
    \item[$\bullet$] SkinTypeResult: The app displays the conveyed skin type results and corresponding explanations on the screen. Users can use this screen to gain a better understanding of their skin and receive recommendations for cosmetic ingredients suitable for their skin.
    \item[$\bullet$] Challenge: Users can measure their daily skin score, divided into four areas, each with checkboxes containing data ranging from 5 to 25 points. Clicking these checkboxes fills the circular line graph at the top in real-time, allowing users to visually check their scores. These scores are transmitted to the backend and recorded daily.
    \item[$\bullet$] Cosmetics: When a user completes the skin type test, the results are stored in their user information and utilized for the cosmetic recommendation feature. If there are no skin type results in the backend, it notifies the user of an error. The skin type results are sent to the backend to initiate web scraping using the 'ChromeDriver.' It searches the Olive Young website for key ingredients corresponding to each skin type and provides the front end with the image and name of the first product that appears. The front end presents this data to the user in a chat format to enhance their understanding of the information.
    \item[$\bullet$] Community: A screen where users can share simple daily concerns, skin issues, or express themselves through text or attached photos.
    \item[$\bullet$] Info: There are buttons that allow users to either take the skin type test or access their skin score report. Pressing the "Skin Type Test" button navigates to the skin type test screen, while clicking the "Report" button leads to the Skin Report screen.
    \item[$\bullet$] SkinReport: Clicking the "Report" button allows users to view graphs of their skin scores over one week, three months, and six months. Clicking the "Duration" text and the buttons for one week, three months, or six months displays the corresponding graph in the white box below. Skin score data is retrieved from the backend upon request.\\ 
\end{itemize}

\item[5.] Where It's Taken From: The user interface on the frontend provides a direct gateway for users to interact with the HISKIN service. Users input essential information to access the platform. Furthermore, utilizing the data repository, the interface seamlessly showcases personalized content through an array of visual materials. \\ 

\item[6.] How / Why you Used it: React offers the advantage of easy installation, allowing for the straightforward use of various modules. Additionally, the abundance of examples and a broad community provided ample reference materials for development. Using Expo allowed us to test our application on both Android and iOS seamlessly. The ability to view and modify the screens in real-time during testing further facilitated our development process. Hence, we chose React and Expo for our development.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Module 2: Back-End}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] Purpose: The backend server receives a request from the frontend, performs work in conjunction with the database, and delivers the value back to the frontend. When a user makes a request through an app, the server performs it, and when a value is given, the value is stored in the database. Our team created a backend server using Springboot, a representative framework of Java used by many domestic companies as a development language, and made Amazon EC2 servers operate in a Ubuntu environment. As the database, Hibernate, which is known to be very compatible with spring boots, is used. Build a backend server by storing information necessary for users to use the application in Hibernate. \\ 
    \item[2.] Functionality: The server performs a function of performing a task requested by the user and storing a value corresponding thereto in a database. When a user signs up for membership, information is stored in a database, and when a skin type test is performed, the user's skin type is stored and cosmetics that match it are recommended. It also performs the function of storing scores and time in the database and sending data of the last seven, three, and six months to the frontend whenever the user performs the challenge.

    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[5.] Where It's Taken From: The backend server works with the database while exchanging values from the front end. HI-SKIN's backend server is currently running on AWS EC2 because it's a good platform to run the server for a small amount of money.
\\ 
    \item[6.] How / Why you used it: The backend server performs tasks that need to happen when the user uses the app. It aims to provide satisfactory services to users while storing and importing values in the database. Among many development languages, servers were built using Springboot, a representative framework of Java known to be widely used by Korean companies.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Module 3: AI}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] Purpose: There is a function that helps users manage using home care devices, but it does not give users the feeling of being cared for at the dermatologist even at home. Ending the day and communicating with a friendly AI like a friend during a skincare session that refreshes hard feelings can give users the power to welcome the next day in a good mood. Accordingly, we intend to implement a function that recognizes the user's voice through AI, enables natural conversation, and recommends customized cosmetics according to the user's skin type. To this end, OpenAI's chat completion api will be used to recognize the voice with the user and naturally talk to the user, and the AI function will be connected to SKT's NUGU speaker to output the voice of artificial intelligence.
 \\ 
    \item[2.] Functionality: AI presents an appropriate response using openai's chat completion api based on user utterance information transmitted from the backend. This can be customized to receive responses from only the desired field by limiting its own system to ask only appropriate questions to users. In addition, even though it is the first question of the user, the advantage is that it is possible to induce an appropriate response to the user's request by arbitrarily writing the previous conversation.\\
    Furthermore, we learned natural language processing models to understand the processes that enable us to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. NNLM, Word2Vec, and FastText were used as basic word embedding models to represent prediction-based distributed presentation. Furthermore, from a task perspective, the performance of each model was measured by applying the Naive Bayes classification, cnn, and lstm models to the text classification task. Dataset was combined from dailydialog, isear, and emotion-stimulus to create a balanced dataset with 5 labels: joy, sad, anger, fear, and neutral. Our dataset consists of written dialogues, messages and short stories. Based on the dataset, the model is applied to the multiclass text classification problem and architecture basically consists of data preprocessing, model training and verification, and testing with different inputs. The performance of models are measured by using indicators of accuracy, confusion matrix, and f1 score.

    \item[4.]  Class Components: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\bullet$]Basic Embedding: This is a folder that contains word embedding models such as NNLM, Word2Vec, and FastText. These models convert words into vectors and apply activation functions to learn the semantic relationship between words.
        \item[$\bullet$]CNN: This is a folder that contains convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models suitable for text classification tasks.
        \item[$\bullet$]LSTM: This is a folder that contains the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models which can learn more complex sequence patterns with mitigation of gradient disappearance problems and introduction of gate mechanisms.
        \item[$\bullet$]Fine Tunning: This is a folder that contains naive bayes classification, cnn, and lstm models described in the model folder are applied to the multi-class text classification problem.
        \item[$\bullet$]Fine Tunning Data: This is a folder that contains our datasets which are combined from dailydialog, isear, and emotion-stimulus. It is a balanced dataset with 5 labels: joy, sad, anger, fear, and neutral.
        \item[$\bullet$]Traditional ML: This is a file that includes traditional machine learning with scikit-learn, using Naive Bayes classification, random forest, and linear regression classifiers for emotional text classification problems.
        \item[$\bullet$]Fine Tunning CNN W2V Wiki: This is a file that includes CNN deep network with pretrained 300 dimensional word2vec for emotional text classification problems.
        \item[$\bullet$]Fine Tunning LSTM W2V Wiki: This is a file that includes LSTM, Bi-LSTM deep network with pretrained 300 dimensional word2vec for emotional text classification problems.
        \item[$\bullet$]Openai: This is a folder that contains an openai model to respond to the user's utterance.
        \item[$\bullet$]Function: This is a folder that contains AI backend codes which receives data from the nugu speaker, executes machine learning, and sends the result value as a response.



    \end{itemize}

    \item[5.] Where It's Taken From: AI is used to receive user utterance information received from the nugu speaker and output a response. In addition, this can provide a more appropriate response to the user based on the previous conversation history with the user.\\
    
    \item[6.] How / Why you used it: We used openai because we can customize the prompt so that we can ask the user the appropriate questions and answers in the desired field. In addition, even though it is the user's first question, it is possible to to induce an appropriate response to the user's request by using an conversation template.\\
