\begin{abstract}

Nowadays, with the increasing importance of skincare, a growing number of busy modern people are trying skincare at home by purchasing beauty devices instead of going to a dermatologist. For these customers, companies such as LG and FOREO are providing beauty devices and applications that can be linked to them. However, managing at home with a beauty device has several weaknesses in place of dermatology. First, there is a lack of communication. Many companies are trying to provide communication such as management methods, but it is still not enough to replace dermatology. The second is that it ends with care. Skin care requires care tailored to one's own skin type even after care, but there is a lack of action. To develop an application that can compensate for these weaknesses, our team is trying to develop a user-friendly application called HISKIN that can work with beauty devices for those who have difficulty taking care of their skin. It is managed by a beauty device registered by a user, and at the same time, it enables communication with users by using AI voice recognition technology. It provides communication functions on various topics such as skin care tips, daily conversations, and management methods according to the user's mood in addition to the existing function of providing guidance on how to use devices. Through these functions, we expect users can enjoy the same service as meeting a doctor in person. And also, through additional challenges program, users can take care of their skin not only at the moment they use the device, but also after care or normally. Depending on the user's skin type, the challenge provides a user-friendly skin care function while allowing the user to perform missions such as moisture soothing pack and drinking more than 1L of water per day. In these days, when the desire to be beautiful continues to increase, concerns about good skin are inevitably growing, and our application HISKIN will be a good solution in this situation. \cite{zhang2020impact}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation} 
According to a survey conducted by market research firm Embrain Trend Monitor in 2022, significant changes in awareness about skincare have been observed. The survey targeted 1,000 adults aged 19 to 59 and examined their perceptions related to skincare. The results showed a decrease in satisfaction with their skin condition from 41.4\% in 2019 to 37.8\%. Furthermore, 64.2\% of respondents reported increased concerns about their skin. This data suggests that many people have become less satisfied with their skin condition recently, leading them to desire healthier and more vibrant skin.
\\Several factors contribute to this shift in perception. Firstly, in today's era of social media, platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook provide easy access to information about skincare and beauty. Influencers and beauty experts share product reviews, skincare tips, and personal experiences, inspiring users to take a greater interest in skincare and develop their skincare routines.
\\Secondly, there is a rising interest in health and well-being. Healthy skin is perceived as a crucial indicator of overall health and well-being, prompting many individuals to pursue better health through skincare. Skincare is not only seen as a means to enhance one's appearance but also as a way to improve skin health.
\\As a result of these trends, interest in skincare and beauty devices has been on the rise. According to Embrain Trend Monitor's survey, there is a growing interest in home beauty and skincare. 81.2\% of women perceive skincare devices as popular, and products like those from LG Pra.L and Medique have been predicted to become more prevalent. These devices are considered cost-effective alternatives that allow for convenient skincare at home compared to visiting dermatologists.
\begin{figure} [h]

\end{figure}
\\However, this increased interest and device usage come with some skepticism and concerns. Users have doubts about the safety and effectiveness of skincare devices, and there are worries about the potential side effects of performing skincare independently. In fact, a significant percentage of consumers have experienced side effects when using home beauty devices. According to a 2019 survey by the Consumer Education Center, 10\% of users reported experiencing side effects. This is often due to a lack of information about potential side effects associated with these devices, highlighting a communication gap between users and skincare devices that differs from traditional dermatology practices.
\\In conclusion, the changing perceptions of skincare and home beauty are the result of various interacting factors, leading to emerging market trends and consumer demands related to skincare devices. Therefore, we have decided to create a more comfortable, safe, and user-friendly app to accompany skincare devices to address these evolving consumer needs. \cite{kim2022skincare}


\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item [1] Many people are currently experiencing significant difficulties and discomfort while using skincare beauty devices. The reason for this is that skincare beauty devices often fail to provide users with sufficient information about the potential risks and side effects, unlike procedures conducted by professional skincare experts or dermatologists.\\ \cite{Song2022beautydevice}
\item [2] Consumers often struggle to establish consistent skincare routines even when using skincare beauty devices. This is primarily because these devices typically provide instructions and information specific to the device itself, often lacking personalized advice based on individual users' skin conditions and needs.\\
\item [3] Consumers consider homecare devices as alternatives to dermatological services, seeking a similar experience even if not entirely equivalent. However, currently available skincare beauty devices often fall short in providing users with comprehensive information compared to dermatologists, making users perceive them as somewhat "clinical." Furthermore, when receiving skincare services at a dermatologist's office, the interaction with the dermatologist adds an element of "fun" or engagement to the experience, which is lacking when using skincare beauty devices. Consequently, many consumers desire to acquire enjoyable or informative aspects akin to visiting a dermatologist while using skincare beauty devices.
